# Betris Game

This project implements a Tetris-like game called Betris, where the goal is to place pieces with specific shapes on a board to complete rows without gaps. The game uses solution-searching algorithms and input handling to optimize piece placement on the board.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Programming language used to implement the game.
- **Backtracking**: Employed to search for optimal solutions for piece placement on the board, testing different combinations and backtracking when inconsistencies are found.
